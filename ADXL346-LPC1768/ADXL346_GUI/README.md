This directory contains the code for the GUI developed to test the working of the accelerometer. 

The GUI was developed using LabWindows CVI 2019. To run the code, you need to download and install LabWindows CVI (https://www.ni.com/en-gb/support/downloads/software-products/download.labwindows-cvi.html#353603) on a Windows machine (we used a Windows 7 device, but later versions should work too).

Once LabWindows is installed, you can compile the code to generate an exectuable. On running the executable, you get a GUI which can be used to interact with the accelerometer.
