# ADXL346 - LPC1768

Welcome to the repo for code associated with the 'digital twin' of the implantable for DyNeuMo Mk-1, as part of the supplementary material for the paper "DyNeuMo Mk-1: Design and Pilot Validation of an Investigational Motion-Adaptive Neurostimulator with Integrated Chronotherapy". The 'digital twin' is comprised of an ADXL346 accelerometer connected with an MBED LPC1768 microprocessor. 

The repo consists of a schematic showing how the two are connected, the C code for the microprocessor, the binary file for uploading to the microporcessor, and the code for a GUI developed on CVI LabWindows to interact with the accelerometer.
